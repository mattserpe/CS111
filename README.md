# CS111
Repository for UCLA CS111 (Operating Systems)*.<br>
This code was written for UCLA CS111 with Professor Reiher in Fall 2020.<br>
This code is intended to showcase my coding syles and abilities to prospective employers.<br>
For each lab, the assignment specification is outlined in "assignment.html".<br>
My identifying information has been removed from all documents.<br>
This includes removal of all "README" files requested in the project specifications.<br>
All code was written by me unless otherwise specified in that folder's "README" or "assignment.html"

My Grades for these assignments were as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Lab 0: 100%</li>
  <li>Lab 1A: 100%</li>
  <li>Lab 1B: 100%</li>
  <li>Lab 2A: 99%</li>
  <li>Lab 2B: 92%</li>
  <li>Lab 3A: 96%</li>
  <li>Lab 3B: 98%</li>
  <li>Lab 4A: 105%</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This lab involved setting up our Beaglebone hardware in preparation for Labs 4B & C.<br>
    For this reason, the code written for this part was very simple and so I have excluded it from this repository.</li>
    <li>I recieved extra credit on this lab for helping a classmate setup his Beaglebone.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Lab 4B: 100%</li>
  <li>Lab 4C: 100%</li>
</ul>

*I have attempted to include all files necessary to run the code in each folder but it is possible I may have forgotten an instructor-provided file. Additionally, Lab 4 is designed to be run on Beaglebone hardware. That said, all relevant code I have written for this class is included in this repository.
